 Balanced List

Given a non-empty list of integers, return TRUE if there is a place to split the list so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on other side.
The order of the elements in the list should not be changed.

For example: 

List(1, 5, 3, 3) returns TRUE -> balanced list: 1+ 5 == 3 + 3
List(7, 3, 4) returns TRUE -> balanced list: 7 == 3 + 4
List(1, 3, 5) returns FALSE
